Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple web-based game challenges you to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. Follow the instructions, make your guesses, and see if you can guess the correct number within 10 attempts.

How to Play
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter your guess in the input field.
Click the "Submit guess" button to check if your guess is correct.
You will receive feedback on whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
Keep guessing until you either guess the correct number or reach the maximum limit of 10 guesses.
Features
Randomly generated number for each game.
Visual feedback on the correctness of your guess.
Option to start a new game after finishing or reaching the maximum number of guesses.
Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Dependencies:-
Poppins font is used for styling.

How the Code Works:-
The HTML file (index.html) contains the structure of the game, including the input field, buttons, and result display elements. The styling is managed by the accompanying style.css file.

The JavaScript code embedded in the HTML file handles the game logic. It generates a random number, tracks the user's guesses, and provides feedback on the correctness of each guess. The game ends after 10 guesses, and a "Start new game" button allows you to reset and play again.

Usage
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser to start playing the Number Guessing Game.
